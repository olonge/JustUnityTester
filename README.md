# Just-Unity-Tester

Just Unity Tester is a fork of the very capable AltUnity Tester.

AltUnity Tester is an open-source UI driven test automation tool that helps you find objects in your game and interacts with them using tests written in C#, Python or Java..


Just-Unity-Tester will focus solely on a in-editor testing, with a preference for being **_simple and lightweight_**.
